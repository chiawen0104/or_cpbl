## Introduction
Deciding the starting lineup is a crucial part of the baseball game. For each game, optimizing the lineup to have a good balance between players' offensive and defensive abilities is often the important issue for many fans.  

In this project, assume we are the manager of a professional team where we are given the schedule and opponentâ€™s starter pitcher of each game. We use **IP (Integer Programming) model** to find the best lineup for our team in each game.

## Data
We get the following data from [CPBL website](https://www.cpbl.com.tw):
1. CPBL Player Stats of 2021 season
2. CPBL Game Schedule of 2022 season (Apr - May)
3. CPBL Roster Swap of 2022 season (Apr - May)
